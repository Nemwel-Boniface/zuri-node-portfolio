# zuri-node-portfolio

This is a project where I am supposed to create a basic portfolio and loadthem using Node.js: The project includes 3 html files: `index.html`, `about.html`, and `contact.html`. To accomplish this project, I read through and had a beginners understanding of the followinf modules:
- http module which allows me to create the serverto run my application on
- fs module which allows me to handle files from my local system. i.e `readFile()` method was used to load files from my local system and be displayed to the browser
- url module which provided me with utilities for URL resolution and parsing


The project requirements were as follows:
- Create a portfolio having the following HTML pages:
  - Home: The homepage should contain your data (bio)
  - About: The about me page should contain brief information about you
  - Contact: The contact page should contain links to your social media
- Create a server using the HTTP module
- Create routes that render the HTML pages you created on a browser
- The base URL of your app should render the homepage
- there should be a /home route that redirects to the base of your app

### Constraints
- No third-party dependencies
- You don‚Äôt need to style your HTML pages


Enjoy!
